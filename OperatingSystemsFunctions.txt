Another function of the operating system: Processor Management 
Processes include programs or routines that provide support for other programs or hardware.
Operating system (OS) allocates the processor (CPU) to a process and de-allocates the processor when it is no longer needed.
Os determines the order in which the processes have access to the processor and the processing time of each process. 
This function of OS is called process scheduling.
